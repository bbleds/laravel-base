# Docker Laravel Starter

This is a lightweight development environment via Docker for Laravel applications. This is intended to be a first step when starting a new app/build and only requires image packages that are absolutely necessary to run a fresh or basic laravel project.

Before running, be sure to install docker and docker compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
